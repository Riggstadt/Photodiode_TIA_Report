# Photodiode Amplifier Collection
This repo contains detailed technical documentation of my amplifier designs for Photodiodes.

The documents of interest, collected from several different project repositories, pertain to various experiments with transimpedance amplifiers and photodiodes.

- <a href="PD_DESIGN_REVIEW.pdf">Review of prior TIA design
- <a href="SIMPLE_PHOTODETECTOR.pdf">Simple, resistive Photodetector</a>
- <a href="CIRCUIT_DESIGN_WORKFLOW_TIA.pdf">Design and component selection process for Op-amp-based Transimpedance amplifier</a>
- <a href="UPDATED_TIA_CIRCUIT_DESIGN.pdf">Updated TIA design, with several improvements</a>
- <a href="CMOS_INVERTER_BASED_TIA.pdf">CMOS Inverter as simple Transimpedance Amplifier</a>

... And for some of my earlier experiments with simple, intended for DC currents, transimpedance amplifiers, please see <a href="Op-amp Transimpedance Amplifier">here</a>
